# RRT
Consider the map attached as image_map.mat. The 0 value represents an obstacle, the 1 value is a free
point in the partitioned map. To show the map, use the command imshow(image_map). Implement
yourself in a software program the RRT method for a point robot moving in the above map from $q_i$= [20 20] to $q_f$=  [125 400].
Select a suitable maximum number of iterations and show the
obtained graph is a solution has been found. Otherwise, report a failure and increase the maximum
number of iterations. Repeat the procedure for a finite number of times at your choice.

In the pdf: "RRT.pdf" the analysis made is explained in detail.
